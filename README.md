# Front-end Software Engineer // Publishing // React/Node // Up to £90,000

We've all seen The Devil Wears Prada right? Well, if you haven't, stop reading this post and go watch it. It's a class film.

Yesterday I had the chance to visit an office which reminded me of that film - take away the elitism, corporate nature, and instead replace it with a great team feeling and smiling faces. But my word, that office is amazing!

I'm working with one of the world's leading publishers. You will 100% know these brands and have interacted with them in the past, and they're looking for a number of software engineers, from a midweight level to lead (£50ish - £90ish).

You'll be working on a React and Node replatforming across their brands, in a TDD environment. They're keen to speak to engineers with experience in these fields, with CI/CD pipelining experience a huge plus too. Important things for them is that team feel I mentioned earlier, as well as being a great communicator and understanding the whole software dev cycle.

Come and join one of London's coolest brands, in a happy, diverse team.

<b>What skills do you need?</b>

The predominant skills needed for this role are about previous experience and knowledge in helping scale start-ups, ecommerce, marketplace platforms or ticketing based systems.

As part of this, having an understanding of how to expand technology teams, and support across tech, dev ops and new products will be necessary.
